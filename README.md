## Graphics Framework/Application in C++
This is a repository that includes my C++ scripts that were used for my assignment in the Graphics module. The aim of the assignment was to build our own graphics framework/application, and by using the C++ language and a lot of vertex and matrices calculations, simulate a camera that rotates around two objects. The framework also includes lights and different types of lights, while also different type of proejections (orthographic and perspective). <br><br>
Even though I'm more into software engineering rather than working with Graphics and in the Game industry, I thought that this assignment was the perfect chance for me to learn to use C++ effectively and with confidence.
